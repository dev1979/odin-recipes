    <h2>Crispy Air Fryer Chicken Wings</h2>
    <p>Make Perfectly Crispy Air Fryer Chicken Wings with this easy method, including seven different flavor options for wings everyone will love.</p>
    <p>We know how much you all love chicken wings. While some may consider chicken wings to be delicious party food, we think they’re 
        just delicious food, no party required! We’ve been known to make a ton of them for dinner, or to simply snack on over 
        the weekend with the family. There really isn’t a wrong way to eat chicken wings. Sadly, there are times that we really don’t 
        want to turn on the oven and warm up the house, meaning we’ve had to come up with other methods to get our wing fix. Air fryer 
        to the rescue! Wings cooked in the air fryer are still just as perfectly crispy, with the most flavorful meat. Time to get your air 
        fryer off the shelf and give these a try!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Basic Crispy Chicken Wings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon aluminum-free baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Honey Garlic</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>5 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Basic Crispy Chicken Wings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a wire rack onto a baking sheet. Use paper towels to pat chicken wings as dry as possible and place into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together baking powder, salt, pepper, and paprika (and any additional flavor additions you'd like to use). 
            Sprinkle over chicken wings and toss until wings are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Take wings from refrigerator and carefully place the 
            individual wings in the air fryer making sure that there is space between them, lightly spritz with oil and cook them for 12 minutes then 
            flip and cook for 12 more minutes.</li>
        <li>To give them that extra crispy exterior, increase the temp to 390-400 degrees Fahrenheit and finish off 
            cooking these for another 5-6 minutes until crispy and brown and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. 
            Cooking time will vary based on the size of your chicken wings.</li>
        <li>Serve plain hot, or use desired sauces and variations.</li>
            
    </ol>
    <h3>Honey Garlic</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add in garlic and saute 90 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add in honey, water, vinegar, and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Add prepared and cooked chicken wings to a large mixing bowl. Pour in sauce and toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
