    <h3>Lamb</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 pounds leg of lamb</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice freshly squeezed</li>
        <li>8 cloves minced garlic minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
  
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pan drippings</li>
        <li>1 white onion diced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1/3 cup minced chives</li>
        <li>1/3 cup minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine or red grape juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Put your leg of lamb in a roasting pan and pour lemon juice over it. 
            In a small bowl mix together garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Using your hands, rub the spices all over the lamb.</li>
        <li>Roast the lamb for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. After 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees. 
            Continue roasting for about 1 hour longer, until your meat thermometer reads 145 degrees.</li>
        <li>Remove lamb from oven and let rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>While the lamb is resting, make your sauce by pouring all of the drippings from the roasting pan into a medium-sized sauce pan. 
            Get all the little bits, and burned chunks that you can.</li>
        <li>Heat the sauce pan over medium-high heat. Add in onions and sauté for 5-7 minutes. Add in herbs and flour and sauté for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add in chicken stock and grape juice and bring to a boil. Sauce should begin to thicken.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Strain out all the herbs and onions (if desired), leaving a pure sauce. 
            Serve the sauce drizzled over the lamb once it is sliced.</li>
    </ol>
